# TRLIID
## Twin Robot LiDAR Inertial Indoor Dataset

## 1. Introduction
**TRILIID** is a twin robot LiDAR inertial indoor dataset which is collected in Digital building, Kumoh national institute of technology. It consists of sequences of two different paths that contain dynamic objects.
Data was collected by attaching 'RPLIDAR A3' and 'IntelliThings IAHRS' sensors to Turtlebot 2e.
This dataset was collected by Multi Agent System Laboratory(MASL).
